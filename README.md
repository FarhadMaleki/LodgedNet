# LodgedNet

LodgedNet is an architecture for crop lodging prediction from UAV-acquired images of wheat and canola using a DCNN augmented with handcrafted texture features. The paper will be available soon.

## Getting Started
The proposed architecture has been designed to work with 5-channel data: red, blue, green, red edge, and near infrared.

### Prerequisites

The main dependencies of LodgeNet are numpy, pandas, and pytorch and torchvision. See _**requirements.txt**_ for the list of requirements.
